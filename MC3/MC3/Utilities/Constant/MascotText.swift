//    "Thomas Edison, the brilliant inventor, faced countless obstacles and failures throughout his journey. When he was working on inventing the electric light bulb, he encountered numerous setbacks and experiments that didn't yield the desired results. However, Edison didn't let these failures discourage him. Instead, he viewed each setback as a valuable lesson and an opportunity to learn and improve.", "One day, a reporter approached Edison and asked him, \"How does it feel to have failed 1,000 times?\" Edison responded with great enthusiasm, saying, \"I have not failed 1,000 times. I have successfully discovered 1,000 ways that do not work.\"", "In similar circumstances, I typically find comfort in music. That's what I hope it does for you as well. Put your feet up, unwind, and let the music soothe your soul. Want to try it? I find that breathing is also helpful at times."
